    <string name="help_text_sight_activity">"Welcome to Prague, one of the most shining gems among Central European cities. Our guide will accompany you in its streets and will notify you unobtrusively whenever you get close to an interesting sight. Then you can see how the sight looks from your standpoint and listen to some information about it. Tap on the screen to open the audio player control panel.

You can choose in the application settings whether you prefer to stroll freely or to follow a specific route. In the latter case you can see the direction to the next sight on the route after finishing the audio comment for the current sight or after pressing the Stop button. 

We wish you an enjoyable stay in Prague."</string>
